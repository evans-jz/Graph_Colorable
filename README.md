# Graph_Colorable
"In graph theory, a uniquely colorable graph is a k-chromatic graph that has only one possible (proper) k-coloring up to permutation of the colors.
A complete graph is uniquely colorable, because the only proper coloring is one that assigns each vertex a different color."

This Program is intended to traverse through a given graph using any method of graph traversal.
the program hits every node exactly once and determines whether or not this given graph is two colorable.
